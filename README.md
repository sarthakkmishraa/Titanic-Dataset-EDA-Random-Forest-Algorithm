# Titanic-Dataset-EDA-Random-Forest-Algorithm
This is a small ML project on the Titanic dataset. The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the data with the help of graphs, processing the data and finally applying the Random Forest algorithm to predict the survival based on the features.

The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
