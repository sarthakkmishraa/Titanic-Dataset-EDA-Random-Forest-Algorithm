# Titanic-Dataset-EDA-Random-Forest-Algorithm


The aim of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and predict the survival on the basis of various features in the dataset such as Age, Sex, Passenger class (Pclass), number of siblings or spouses (Sibsp) , no. of parents or children (Parch) , Boarding points (Embarked) , Fare and so on.

The dataset contains two sets as training dataset (train.csv) and testing dataset (test.csv). 

The EDA is performed on the training data and conclusions are drawn on the basis of which the data is preprocessed after which the machine learning algorithm ( random forest ) is applied on the training data.

The predictions are then made on the testing data and the results are stored in a csv file as the output.

I managed to achieve 80% accuracy in the predictions. 

More details, check the code. :)
